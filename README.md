# IOTA Improvement Proposal (IIP) Repository

IIPs are improvement proposals for bettering the IOTA technology stack.

Building the IOTA ecosystem is a community effort, therefore we welcome anyone to propose, discuss and debate ideas that will later become formalized IIPs.

## Propose new ideas

Do you have an idea how to improve the IOTA technology stack?
- Head over to the [discussions](https://github.com/iotaledger/iips/discussions) page to browse already submitted ideas or share yours!
- Once your idea is discussed, you can submit a draft IIP ([template here](https://github.com/iotaledger/iips/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md) as a PR to the repository.
- You will receive feedback from the IIP Editors, core devs and community members to refine your proposal.
- Once accepted, your IIP is merged as Draft.
- It is your responsibility to drive its implementation and to present a clear plan on how the new feature will be adopted by the network.
- Once implementation is ready and testing yields satisfactory result, the IIP becomes Proposed.
- Proposed IIPs that are supported by majority of the network become Active.

You may find more information about the IIP Process in [IIP-1](./iips/IIP-0001/iip-0001.md).

## List of IIPs

 - Last updated: 2025-04-18
 - The _Status_ of a IIP reflects its current state with respect to its progression to being supported on the IOTA Mainnet.
   - `Draft` IIPs are work in progress. They may or may not have a working implementation on a testnet.
   - `Proposed` IIPs are demonstrated to have a working implementation on the IOTA Devnet or Testnet.
   - `Active` IIPs are supported on the IOTA Mainnet.
   - `Replaced` IIPs have been replaced by a newer IIP.
   - `Obsolete` IIPs are no longer in use.
